							<p>As in the 2 column exercise, the color change is
								detectible where the div meets the .jpg background. I used the
								same hexidecimal number in the PS doc as was used in the HTML?</p>
							<p>This exercise uses a main wrapper background image as one
								fixed strip. I get serious Float Drop when I resize (reduce) the
								browser window. I think that is what "display:inline;/* stops IE
								doubling margin on float" is for, but would like further
								explaination to understand this comment.</p>
							<p>Is keeping the #wrapper div necessary in a stylesheet if
								there is also going to be seperate version wrappers as we have
								here to contain the different background images? Or perhaps this
								is an example of an inner div as the book suggests? I am still
								congused on that detail.</p>
							<p>Even though I have auto margin sets on the wrapper div,
								the page still huggs the left side? I've tried it in all of
								them, but it won't budge?</p>
							<p>Obviously, this footer has a mind of it's own...it's in
								the wrapper, but the "clear" seems to be allowing it outside.
								However, when I remove the clear, it hugs the bottom of the
								header?</p>
